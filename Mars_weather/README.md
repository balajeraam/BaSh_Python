We have 3 different variants of the same project published in the repository
- Level 1 : Simplest of them is pure execution of the project with output appearing as result in the python terminal
- Level 2 : Second variant  is adding a user friendly Graphical User Interface (GUI) with the help of Tkinter module
- Level 3 : Third variant is GUI plus additional background music during the output display
